Using the MESE model with 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I find prior mathematics proficiency and personality have been previously underestimated in the STEM retention literature.

The aim is to cover a broad range of methods having differing levels of complexity and strength of the required assumptions. Simple approaches that form the elementary building blocks of more advanced approaches are discussed ﬁrst. Then, special attention is devoted to methods that rely on readily available auxiliary variables (e.g., repeated measurements, indicators, or instrumental variables). Results relaxing most of the commonly invoked simplifying assumptions are presented (linear measurement structure, independent errors, zero-mean errors, availability of auxiliary information). This article also provides an overview of important connections with related ﬁelds, such as latent variable models, nonlinear panel data, factor models, and set identiﬁcation, and applications of the methods to other ﬁelds traditionally unrelated to measurement error models.},

This gives us the possibility to test whether private and public health expenditures have different impacts on life expectancy at different levels of public expenditure as a share of GDP. Panel unit root tests show that all series in clusters are not difference stationary. Co-integration is found for countries with high public expenditure as a share of GDP. The results, augmented with panel VAR models and impulse response analysis, stress the importance of the positive relationship between public health expenditures and life expectancy. Additional results based on private health expenditure as a share of GDP show also the importance of private expenditures for life expectancy, although these are, at the same time, also driven up by public health expenditures.},

Using predicted mortality as an instrument, we find that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy leads to a 1.7–2 percent increase in population.

Canadian per capita drug expenditures increased markedly in recent years and have become center stage in the debate on health care cost containment. To inform public policy, these costs must be compared with the benefits provided by these drugs. This paper measures the statistical relationship between drug spending in Canadian provinces and overall health outcomes. The analysis relies on more homogenous data and includes a more complete set of controls for confounding factors than previous studies. Results show a strong statistical relationship between drug spending and health outcomes, especially for infant mortality and life expectancy at 65. This relationship is almost always stronger for private drug spending than for public drug spending. The analysis further indicates that substantially better health outcomes are observed in provinces where higher drug spending occurs. Simulations show that if all provinces increased per capita drug spending to the levels observed in the two provinces with the highest spending level, an average of 584 fewer infant deaths per year and over 6 months of increased life expectancy at birth would result.

Some new dynamic panel model estimators, argued to be more efficient with high persistence series and predetermination compared to popular but complex GMM estimators, show that public health expenditures are generally more health-promoting than private expenditures. However, the health effects are not as great as primary education effects.

	abstract = {We use cross-national data to examine the impact of both public spending on health and non-health factors (economic, educational, cultural) in determining child (under-5) and infant mortality. There are two striking findings. First, the impact of public spending on health is quite small, with a coefficient that is typically both numerically small and statistically insignificant at conventional levels. Independent variation in public spending explains less than one-seventh of 1\% of the observed differences in mortality across countries. The estimates imply that for a developing country at average income levels the actual public spending per child death averted is \$50,000-100,000. This stands in marked contrast to the typical range of estimates of the cost effectiveness of medical interventions to avert the largest causes of child mortality in developing countries, which is \$10-4000. We outline three possible explanations for this divergence of the actual and apparent potential of public spending. Second, whereas health spending is not a powerful determinant of mortality, 95\% of cross-national variation in mortality can be explained by a country's income per capita, inequality of income distribution, extent of female education, level of ethnic fragmentation, and predominant religion.},

Our empirical results strongly support both Wagner's law and the hypothesis that government spending is helpful to economic growth regardless of how we measure the government size and economic growth. When the countries are disaggregated by income levels and the degree of corruption, our results also confirm the bi-directional causality between government activities and economic growth for the different subsamples of countries, with the exception of the low-income countries. It is suggested that the distinct feature of the low-income countries is likely owing to their inefficient governments and inferior institutions.},

	abstract = {It has now been more than 40 years since the first attempts of defining and data collection on informal sector and informal employment on a large scale were launched in the early 1970s. Many debates paved the way for the international definition of the informal sector in 1993 and informal employment in 2003. The informal economy is finally a means for conciliating the two concepts and since the mid-1970s, national estimates of size (employment) and contribution (share of gross domestic product [GDP]) of the informal sector, and later on of the informal economy (and of its two major components: informal sector and employment outside the informal sector), have regularly been attempted and gathered on a large scale. This article is the most recent synthesis of these works. It is based on the recent compilations by the Bureau of Statistics of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the National Accounts Section of the United Nations (UN) Statistics Division as well as on original national data. Employment in the informal economy is revealed to be as high as 58–70 per cent of non-agricultural employment at regional level (the informal sector representing from 50 per cent to 80 per cent of the informal economy) and the informal sectors contribution to non-agricultural GDP is from 25 per cent up to 50 per cent., JEL Classifications: O17, O57, J21},

	abstract = {The article is devoted to discussing the problem with using the gross domestic product (GDP) indicator to assess the level of the country’s economic development. The paper reveals the main disadvantages of the methodology for calculating this indicator: inaccurate accounting of changes in the level of increment (depletion) of the national wealth; ignoring the problem of inequitable distribution of value added among countries; exaggeration of GDP due to the imposed consumption; including of the accrued and forming indicators in the GDP; the neglect of labor within the households and the mutual exchange of goods and services; and the neglect of changes in the structure and quality of products when using base price technology. The problems related to calculating GDP by the purchasing power parity and per capita are considered. The possibilities of using GDP as a key macroeconomic indicator are discussed. It is substantiated that high rates of GDP growth do not always point to high efficiency of the country’s economic activity. That is why the focus of public authorities mainly on the GDP indicator can damage the economy of the country. The article concludes that it is necessary to expand the range of indicators used to assess the level of development of the national economy, as well as to improve the methodology for calculating the GDP.},
