Nadav Project Notes:

military spending:
- LASSO: worried about sparsity assumption, since one country's spending can affect another's which can affect another
- take look at sparsity book (they have chart on graphs)
- you might find some data evidence for this, but most of these issues come from assumptions made 

Population Dist. and CO2
- it's a hard pitch
- 2 problems: don't think it's stationary (not sure if data trained on 10 years ago is still predictive), ideally one would put it in a framework that can be justified ahead of time (like why would we use Random Forest and Population)

Political Instability:
- Nico's pitch: deal with attenuation bias by extracting "real value" using PCA instead of using IV
- Nadav says that it sounds interesting
- he recommends paper by Oster
- simulated vs real data: if use simulated data it would be good to give justifications for situation in paper
